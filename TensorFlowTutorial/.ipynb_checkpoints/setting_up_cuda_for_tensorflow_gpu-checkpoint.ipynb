    "I recently bought a new laptop with a ** Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 Ti / PCI-E / SSE2** graphics card which is compatible with CUDA 6.1. So I decided to set up TensorFlow with GPU. It took me some trial and error to set it up so I decided to write down the steps for future reference and as a tutorial for people trying to set it up.  \n",

    "For my case, I selected:  \n",

I used \"12345678\" because its easy to remember. You only need to use the password another time when your machine reboots. The password is used to verify disabling secure boot.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Then reboot your machine and there will be a prompt asking you if you want to disable secure boot. If you missed this dialogue or select the wrong option, I have no idea how to bring it back up. The way I did it is by purging CUDA and installing it again because I selected the wrong option at the first time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Then it'll ask for the password at position x. For example, using the password \"abcdefgh\". The password for position 4 would be 'd' and the password for position 7 would be 'g'. To make it simple, just use \"12345678\" and you just have to retype the same number as the position.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Or if your UEFI allows, just switch to legacy mode and disable secure boot through the boot menu. Or just simply disable secure boot."
