# Audio Processing

Some code sample for processing audio. The clean version is Audio_File_Visualization.ipynb.  
Other files are randomly hacked together to make things work. A better version will be up soon in the VoiceClassification folder.  

Old_Classifier.ipynb and tfclassifier.py are old classifiers used for audio classification.  

The LibriSpeech data and audio samples are not uploaded due to large file size.
